# Insight Attendance - Smart Face Recognition Attendance System üéìüì∏

An advanced, automated attendance management system that leverages real-time facial recognition, computer vision, and cloud integration to transform traditional and online educational environments.

## üìå Project Overview

**Insight Attendance** is designed to streamline the attendance-taking process using facial recognition. It not only automates roll calls but also captures student engagement levels and ensures accuracy through advanced machine learning algorithms and real-time database updates via Firebase.

## üöÄ Features

- üîç **Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition**
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Firebase Integration** (Realtime Database & Cloud Storage)
- üïí **Threshold-Based Attendance Logic**
- üß† **Machine Learning-Based Face Encodings**
- üíª **Tkinter GUI and OpenCV-Based User Interface**
- üìä **Excel Sheet Export of Attendance Logs**
- üîê **Secure Data Handling with Consent-Based Storage**
- üîÑ **Continuous Learning & Performance Tracking**
- üì° **Supports Remote Learning via Webcam**
- üß© **API-ready architecture for third-party integration**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `OpenCV`, `cvzone`, `face_recognition`, `dlib`, `numpy`, `pickle`
  - `firebase_admin`, `datetime`, `tkinter`, `os`, `pandas`
- **Tools & Platforms**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Firebase Realtime Database & Storage
  - Lucidchart (for system design & block diagrams)
  - Excel (for reporting)
  - Git & GitHub (for version control)

## üì∑ System Flow (High Level)

1. **Registration**: Face data of students is captured and stored with their information.
2. **Detection**: System captures live feed, detects face using HOG/CNN, and encodes it.
3. **Recognition**: Matches the live encoding with stored data and updates attendance.
4. **Storage**: Records are stored securely in Firebase and exported to Excel for records.
5. **Feedback**: UI displays user-specific attendance info and status messages in real-time.

## üß™ Testing & Validation

- Real-time detection and recognition tested under varying light conditions.
- Accuracy verified using Euclidean distance between encodings.
- Duplicate entry prevention via 30-second window logic.
- Attendance threshold set at minimum 60% of class time.

## üîí Privacy & Ethics

- All student data was collected with explicit consent.
- Data is deleted post-dissertation as per ethical guidelines.
- The system is compliant with data protection practices using Firebase security rules and local encryption.

## üß† Future Enhancements

- Support for multi-face detection.
- Liveness detection to avoid spoofing.
- Mobile app integration.
- Blockchain-based tamper-proof attendance logs.
- Expanded analytics dashboard with trend visualization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Insight-Attendance.git
   cd Insight-Attendance
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure Firebase:
   - Place your `servicekey.json` in the root directory.
   - Update the Firebase URL and storage bucket path in the script.

4. Run the app:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## üìä Sample Output

- Real-time UI shows student name, ID, year, and attendance count.
- Auto-generates an Excel sheet (`Attendance_YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`) with daily logs.
- Feedback messages: `Recognized`, `Already Marked`, `Unrecognized`.
